### Here are some models created by using machine learning algorithms. The datasets used do not contain real values and all the values used for different features are fake. In these models, various techniques for data training are introduced, and you can see the use of the following items in these models.
- Data Preprocessing
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Dimension reduction by PCA and TSNE
- Evaluation
- Correlation
- Outliers removing
